# Code-for-RNA-seq_Analysis
This repository contains scripts and code for processing and analyzing Thlaspi arvense RNA-seq data using high-performance computing and R which has been described in the manuscript "Morpho-physiological and transcriptomic responses of field pennycress to waterlogging" by Combs-Giroir et al 2024. This manuscript showcases the transcriptomic response of pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) root, leaf, and pod tissues to 1 week of waterlogging at the reproductive developmental stage, as well as 3 hours after recovery from waterlogging. The data was processed using the Ohio Supercomputer (osc.edu) and analyzed in Rstudio.

If you wish to use the code within this repository for your own work, please cite our manuscript. If you would like access to the RNA-seq dataset, please see NCBI BioProject PRJNA1135492 or email gschwend.2@osu.edu.

Thank you and happy coding!
